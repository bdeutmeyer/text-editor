# Text Editor PWA

## Description

This progressive web application is a text editor. As users type within the editor, the text is saved to the browser's database. The data will persist on reload, and the application can be used while offline. Additionally, a user can install the application onto their local computer.

## Credits

Most of this application consists of the starter code provided for the challenge, and the rest was pretty much entirely found in the course curriculum. All I did was modify curriculum code to fit this application.
